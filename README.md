### Introduction

This Personal Webpage for Keye Zhang was designed and implemented as a single-page website with specified functionality and formatting using only HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. This Personal Webpage is derived from one of my course project of The Art of Web and Programming, which gave me first-hand experience with HTML5 (e.g. header, canvas, video), CSS3/SASS (e.g. use of webfonts, animations, layout), and Javascript(ES5 or ES6).

### Functions 

1. Layout: All content is laid out in a single page with full-width horizontal stripes/sections including a header and a footer - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/2.png?raw=true)
2. Sticky Navbar: A top navigation bar that sticks to the top of the window when scrolling - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/3.gif?raw=true)
3. Position Indicator: Indicator of the current reading position visible in the navigation bar (see above gif for example). 
4. Navbar Resizing: Navigation bar is larger when users are at the top of the page. As users start scrolling down, it resizes and becomes smaller. The text fontsize also starts larger and becomes smaller as users scroll down - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/4.gif?raw=true)
5. Smooth Scrolling: Smooth scrolling when navigating to a different section using the navigation bar - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/5.gif?raw=true)
6. Carousel: A section with a carousel/slider. It includes the navigation arrows on the side - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/6.gif?raw=true)
7. Multi-column layout: A section with Multi-column content - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/8.png?raw=true)
8. Background Image: A section with a fixed-position background image - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/9.gif?raw=true)
9. Modal: A section which uses modal windows with additional content - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/10.gif?raw=true)
10. Video: Embedded video using HTML5 video tag - [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-web-programming/fa17/master/labs/MP-1/11_2.gif?raw=true)
11. CSS3 Animations: Use of CSS3 animations (e.g. fade in/out, transitions)
12. Use of scalable vector icons through CSS (e.g. FontAwesome)
